Exercise 3.2.3 <br>
When calculating purity should we divide with the size of the cluster inside the sum or the total amount of points outside the sum? So basically? <br> $purity =\sum_{i=1}^r \frac{1}{|C_i|}max_{j=1,...,k}(N_{ij})$
or $purity =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^r max_{j=1,...,k}(N_{ij})$   <br>
I know the latter is provided in the notes, but since it also states _The purity of a clustering is the weighted sum of the purity of each cluster_ it seems the former would be more correct.

Exercise 3.3.3 <br>
What _class\_labels_ should we use as ground truth when evaluating CE in the exercise?
